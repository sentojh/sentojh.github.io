I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/index.do) (Pohang University of Science and Technology), South Korea.

Currently, I have worked and researched in [Robotics Lab](http://rnb.postech.ac.kr/index.html) advised by Prof. [Wan Kyun Chung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fRu22vsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My major research interests are in robot control.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
