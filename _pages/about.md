I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/index.do) (Pohang University of Science and Technology), South Korea.

Currently, I have worked and researched in [Robotics Lab](http://rnb.postech.ac.kr/index.html) advised by Prof. [Wan Kyun Chung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fRu22vsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My major research interests are in robot control.
